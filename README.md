# Registration-Servlet
This program is a simple registration Servlet designed to register user information into a MySQL database. It utilizes Java Servlet technology to handle a registration form, accept user input via a web interface, and store the data in a database.

Core Functions:
1.Receiving Data:

The program collects user input from the registration form (e.g., name, email, phone, organization, and position) through an HTTP POST request.

2.Storing Data in the Database:
Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC.
Inserts the data into the users table using an INSERT INTO SQL statement.

3.Displaying Confirmation:
Upon successful data insertion, the user is redirected to a confirmation page (e.g., confirmation.jsp) to display a success message.

4.Technologies Used:
Java Servlet API: For server-side processing.
JDBC: To interact with the database.
MySQL: For storing user data.
HTML and JSP: For the user interface (registration form and confirmation page).

Features:
Ease of Implementation: The program is simple and easy to understand, serving as a starting point for beginners in web application development with Java.
Dynamic Design: Allows flexible user data submission and processing.
Error Handling: Displays clear error messages to the user in case of issues.

Workflow:
The user fills out the registration form with their information.
The data is sent to the /register endpoint via a POST request.
The server processes the data and stores it in the database.
The user is redirected to a confirmation page or shown an error message if an issue occurs.

Notes:
The program requires a MySQL database to be set up in advance with a users table.
The program depends on the MySQL JDBC Driver, which should be configured in the code.
Enhancements like data validation and more detailed error handling are recommended for better functionality and security.
